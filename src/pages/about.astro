    <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
      I am a software engineer working at the intersection of AI, systems, and product thinking.
      My work focuses on building practical, well-structured software that connects research,
      engineering, and real-world use.

    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-7 text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
      Over the years, I have worked on AI-driven systems, simulation and graphics workflows,
      developer tools, and internal platforms. I am especially interested in how complex systems
      can be made simpler, more reliable, and easier to reason about.

      <li>write technical notes and long-form blog posts</li>

      Most of the content here grows out of things I am actively building, testing, or thinking
      about. Some posts are polished, others are closer to working notes. The goal is clarity
      rather than completeness.
