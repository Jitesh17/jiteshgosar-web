        I am a software engineer working at the intersection of <strong class="text-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-200">AI, systems, and product thinking</strong>. My work focuses on building practical, well-structured software that connects research, engineering, and real-world use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I have worked on AI-driven systems, simulation workflows, and internal platforms. I am especially interested in how complex systems can be made simpler, more reliable, and easier to reason about.

        This website is a personal space where I:

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 marker:text-neutral-400 dark:marker:text-neutral-600">
        <li>Write technical notes and long-form journal entries.</li>
        <li>Document ideas, experiments, and "working notes".</li>
        <li>Share interactive demos and small projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Most of the content here grows out of things I am actively building. The goal is <span class="text-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-200">clarity rather than completeness</span>.
