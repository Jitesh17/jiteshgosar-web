HackMD is a powerful tool for writing, sharing, and collaborating on notes or blog posts using Markdown.

I use HackMD regularly to write technical notes and long-form posts. You can find all my public HackMD notes here:

This post explains:
- how to create HackMD notes
- how to publish them
- how to collaborate and share notes live

HackMD provides three ways to create a new note from the website:

1. Create an empty note by clicking **New note**.
2. Create a new note from an existing template.
3. Import an existing file from GitHub.

### Creating a new note from a template
When you select **New note from template**, you can either choose an existing template or create your own.

This is useful when you frequently write similar types of documents, such as meeting notes, tutorials, or project documentation.

### Importing a file from GitHub and editing it in HackMD
HackMD allows you to directly import Markdown files from GitHub and edit them in the browser.

Steps:
1. Click **Import file from GitHub**.
2. Select the repository, branch, and file you want to edit.

If your GitHub account is not already linked, HackMD will prompt you to connect and authorize access.

Once connected, you can easily:

- **Push** updates back to GitHub

HackMD supports live collaboration where one person controls scrolling for all viewers. This is especially useful for presentations or walkthroughs of long notes.

Steps:
1. Click the **n ONLINE** button in the top-right corner.
2. Select the user who should act as the host.
